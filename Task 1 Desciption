Task 1: Building a Machine Learning Algorithm to Predict Car Prices

1. Dataset Loading and Statistical Analysis:
   - Loaded the dataset and performed statistical analysis to understand the dataset characteristics.

2. Feature Engineering:
   - Derived the age of vehicles from the 'Make_year' feature to enhance the dataset.

3. Handling Null Values and Unique Counts:**
   - Checked for null values and unique counts in the dataset to understand data completeness and variability.

4. Data Columns Division based on Data Types:**
   - Segregated data columns based on their data types for easier data processing.

5. Handling Consistent Entry in the Price Column:**
   - Separated all entries with "call for Price" in the 'Price' column to handle them separately during further processing.

6. Encoding Categorical Variables and Price Data Type Conversion:**
   - Encoded categorical variables and converted the 'Price' data type to integer for further analysis.

7. Feature Importance Analysis:**
   - Utilized feature importance technique to identify influential features and select potential predictors for the model. Chose all variables initially to observe results without assumptions.

8. Predictor Variable Selection and Price Standardization:**
   - Added chosen variables to the predictor variable ArrayList and standardized the 'Price' values using the Min-Max scaler for uniformity in evaluation metrics.

9. Random Forest Regression with Default Parameters:**
   - Employed Random Forest Regression with default parameters to initially predict car prices.

10. Model Evaluation with R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE):**
   - Assessed model accuracy and error using R-squared and MSE, respectively. Ensured satisfactory performance metrics.

11. Residual Computation and Analysis:**
   - Computed residuals and evaluated their mean to ensure the reliability of the model predictions.

12. Predictions for Experimental Data:
   - Used the developed model to predict prices for cars with "call for Price" entries in the 'Price' column. 
   - Specifically checked predictions for 'Model' = "HS", while also inverse scaling the price. Observed price changes with variations in assembly and other features.
